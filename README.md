## About

This is a simple repo to track and showcase my journey to recreate 20 games, using the list from [The 20 Games Challenge](https://20_games_challenge.gitlab.io/).

## My own rules

I'm adding my own rules to this challenge.

### Rule 1: Make 2 games from each step in the challenge

No more, no less.

There are 10 steps with at least 2 games that you can choose from.

This means that by following this rule, by the end of it, I'll end up making exactly 20 games.

### Rule 2: Keep it simple

Just do what is necessary to replicate the core game.

Don't do advanced stuff (like networking, multiple levels, too much original artwork, etc.).

Only do max 1-2 `Stretch goals`, but no requirement.

### Rule 3: Each game should be complete

This simply means that every game should have:

- Menus (main, settings, and pause)
- One level (no more, no less)
- Win & loose conditions
- Zero bugs (yelp, good luck!)

### Rule 4: Publish the game & the source code

All games and their source code should be publicly available through [itch.io](https://brallex.itch.io/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexander-Jordan).

### Rule 5: Publish a devlog video for each game

Create a devlog video about the process of making each game throughout this challenge.

At the end of the challenge, create a summary video.

Publish them on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@bbitofficial).
